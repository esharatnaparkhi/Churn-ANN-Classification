Churn Prediction Model

This repository contains a deep learning model designed to predict customer churn. It leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to analyze historical customer data and identify patterns that indicate potential churn.

Model Architecture:

Input Layer: Accepts a vector of input features representing customer attributes (e.g., tenure, estimated salary, number of products, geography, gender).
Hidden Layers: Hidden layers with ReLU activation functions to extract complex patterns from the input data.
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to predict the probability of churn (0 for no churn, 1 for churn).

Training and Evaluation:

The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled customer data, where the target variable indicates whether a customer churned or not. The training process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering to prepare the data for model training.
Model Training: Using an appropriate optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam) to minimize the cross-entropy loss function.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
